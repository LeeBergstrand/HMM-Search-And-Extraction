HMMER-DB
========

Software for searching, extracting and storing proteins that match specific Hidden Markov Models. Hits generated by HMMER's hmmsearch are filtered and stored in a SQLite database. After running the HMMER-DB suite the database will contain:

- Information about HMM hits: Protein accession, E-Value, score coverage, etc. 
- Information about hit proteins: Protein accession, Organism accession, locus, location, etc.
- Information about organisms with hits: Organism accession, description and phylogeny, etc.

######Schema:

Optionally we have also included a table called HMM_Data that lets you group certain HMMs into families.

Once the the database is setup one can easily query it using  SQL to gather information about a protein's or group of proteins' potential distribution across multiple taxon. We have also included a few R scripts to help with visualization.
