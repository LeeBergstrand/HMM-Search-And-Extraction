HMMER-DB
========

Software for searching, extracting and storing proteins that match specific Hidden Markov Models. Hits generated by HMMER's hmmsearch are filtred and stored in a SQLite database. After running the HMMER-DB suite the database will contain:

- Information about HMM hits: Protein accession, E-Value, score coverage, etc. 
- Information about hit proteins: Protein accession, Organism accession, locus, location, etc.
- Information about organisms with hits: Organism accession, description and phylogeny, etc.

Optionally we have also included a table called HMM_Data that lets you group certain HMMs into families.

Once the the database is setup one can easily query it using to gather information about potential protein distribution across multiple taxon.
